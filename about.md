{:id="about"}

 I am a student who is very passionate about computer security, information security, penetration testing and red teaming. I work on boxes from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/). I love to help people to get started in ethical hacking, as well as to help them to do boxes from HackTheBox.

 My dream is to become a Certified Penetration Tester and obtain the [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/) (Offensive Security Certified Professional). I have created this blog to show my methodology when doing vulnerable machines and to motivate people to be passionate about computer security !
