## ~$ cat .about

I am a security consultant who is very passionate about computers, security, networking, penetration testing and red teaming. I work on boxes from HackTheBox and VulnHub in my spare time and potentially will write a tool from time to time ðŸ˜´. I love helping people to get started in hacking, pentesting, etc...

I have created this blog to show my methodology when doing vulnerable machines and to motivate people to be passionate about computer security !
